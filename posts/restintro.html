<h2>REST Architecture</h2>
<p>-REST, representational state transfer, defines general constraints to follow while developing APIs. Provides a large amount of flexibility, as it does not demand strict implementation rules</p>
<p>-With REST arch., we can control data over the internet through HTTP commands</p>
<p>-The main idea behind REST is to provide a uniform interoperability between applications on the internet, namely in a stateless manner</p>
<p>-Benefits of REST arch include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>increased performance</li>
	<li>scalability</li>
	<li>extensibility</li>
	<li>modifiability</li>
	<li>simplicity</li>
</ul>

<h2>REST Verbs</h2>
<p>-HTTP methods are available for interacting with resources on the server. The five main verbs used in a well-designed RESTful application are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>GET: read resource</li>
	<li>POST: create resource</li>
	<li>PUT: update existing resource (may create if none exists)</li>
	<li>PATCH: partial update on resource</li>
	<li>DELETE: deletes resource</li>
</ul>
<p>—There are other HTTP verbs as well, such as HEAD, OPTIONS, etc. </p>
<p>-Verbs get, put, post, and delete used for CRUD operations. In practice, patch is a fifth HTTP method that’s quite useful for updating resources with partial data</p>

<h2>Response Codes</h2>
<p>-Communication between client and server in a RESTful system occurs primarily via HTTP response codes</p>
<p>-A client makes a request to the server, which is handled by the controller, mapped to an appropriate endpoint, some business logic and database interaction may occur, and a response code is sent back to the user to convey their request results</p>
<p>-There are five categories for response codes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1xx - Informational</li>
	<li>2xx - Success</li>
	<li>3xx - Redirection</li>
	<li>4xx - Client Error</li>
	<li>5xx - Server Error</li>
</ul>
